## Challenges
### Challenge 1
http://functionapp20180414071532.azurewebsites.net/api/answers

### Challenge 2
http://functionapp20180414071532.azurewebsites.net/api//sort?sortOption=High

Notes:
- Recommended sort is failing, but I think the API return is correct as per my understanding.

### Challenge 3
http://functionapp20180414071532.azurewebsites.net/api/trolleyCalculator

Notes:
- There is an issue in the test app. Instead of calling "trolleyCalculator" it calls "trolleyCalculator/trolleyTotal". However the API implements both the endpoints as a workaround.

## Technologies
- C#, Azure Functions.

## Other Notes
- Use Visual Studio 2017.
